### **1\. Casio Privia PX 160**

This slim, simple 88 key model is a great substitute for a conventional acoustic piano under $1000. You can choose a black finish or opt for a champagne/gold color. The PX 160 also features MIDI USB to allow easy connection to your computer or mobile device. It has inherited many features from the PX150, including the Multi Dimensional Air Sound Source, but Casio has worked on the weaker aspects of the PX150, adding more great features.

One attractive feature of the PX 160 is that it offers great portability. Despite the 88 hammer action keys, the model weighs just 25 pounds, which makes it easy to carry in a gig bag to events or practice halls. Although this digital piano is plastic, it has a great build quality with an easy to navigate control panel and dedicated buttons for common settings and functions.

### **2\. Yamaha P71**

This Amazon exclusive digital piano has 88 weighted keys and offers ten sounds, with layering to create your own unique sound. The Yamaha P71 has a compact, light design with USB connections to connect to a computer for recording your compositions.

The weighted action keys are held by the innovative Yamaha Graded Hammer Action to give the feeling of playing a genuine piano. This creates a higher quality compared to many other digital piano brands and models.

The Yamaha P71 is one of the best digital pianos under $1000 as it offers functionality for beginners or the more experienced player. The P71 offers exceptional sound quality with integrated digital audio acoustic piano sampling to offer realistic and natural sounds. So, whether you want to play a full, rich bass or a crisp treble, this digital piano can deliver. The P71 also features a Duel Mode, so you can record and play different sounds and loops with your music to create a fuller performance.

### **3\. Alesis Recital Pro**

The Alesis Recital Pro has been designed with beginners in mind. It is supplied with a premium subscription for interactive online piano lessons, providing a great grounding for learning to play. This digital piano is equipped with 88 semi weighted keys and adjustable touch response. You can also create layering by combining two sounds. Beginners may also find lesson mode useful, where you can split the keyboard to follow a tutor demonstrating music in one zone, while you play in the other.

The Recital Pro can also be used to record your music via USB MIDI. The model offers 12 voices, including synth, harpsichord, electric piano, acoustic bass, and organ, and you can switch between voices easily with light up buttons to make it clear and easy. The Recital Pro can also be used with batteries, making it ideal if you can’t rely on having an outlet during outdoor gigs.

### **4\. LAGRIMA**

The LAGRIMA is a handsome digital piano with an excellent console packed with features. The LAGRIMA has 88 weighted, full size keys and holds the visual appeal of a spinet. The design has been created to help people learn to play with key weight, finger technique, and console style to make it easier to transition to a traditional piano. Even the pedals are fully operational to provide the experience of an acoustic piano. However, there are also a number of voices and digital functions to further enhance functionality. While the GHS key weight and touch sensitivity help to master finger strength and precision needed for an acoustic piano, the demo songs, LCD screen, and duo mode make it easier for beginners to learn. The LAGRIMA digital piano is capable of 64 level polyphony, 128 MB sound samples with 200 preset rhythms, 480 tones, and 80 demo songs to aid practice and help you to develop your own unique sound.![](//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=lan00ac-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B07RFVSP98)

### **5\. Yamaha YPG535**

Another Yamaha that makes this list of the best digital pianos under $1000 is the YPG535. While this isn’t super portable, with its built in speakers and matching stand, the YPG535 is a great option for those with limited space. The model has a comprehensive control panel with a dedicated button for almost every function and setting, creating a remarkably transparent user interface. There is even a “portable grand” function that creates a grand piano tone across the entire keyboard. While this may appear a little complex, the monochrome display makes it simple to navigate the educational features and functions.

While the YPG535 lacks hammer action keys, the Graded Soft Touch keyboard does provide a semi weighted action and resistance to mimic the qualities of an acoustic piano. There are 127 voices, 361 sounds, and 32 levels of polyphony making this one of the best Yamaha digital pianos on the market.

### **6\. Roland FP 30**

The Roland FP 30 has a sleek, modern design that would fit into most contemporary decor styles. The curved back creates an illusion of wall mounting when it is placed against a wall while still allowing a gap to access the rear ports. You can also choose a white or black finish to suit your preferences.

The simple, yet colorful control panel features well labeled buttons and different colored LEDs to aid navigation. There are 13 buttons for quick access to the most used functions, while a combination of buttons and keys allows navigation of other functions and settings.

What makes the FP 30 stand out as one of the best digital pianos in this price range is the keys. The 88 keys have synthetic ivory tops that create the yellow tint of a classic acoustic piano. The keys use the current generation Roland key action; the PHA-4. This provides genuine hammer action with the weighted keys. This means that like an acoustic piano, the keys feel heavier at the lower end and lighter as you move towards the treble. The keys are also touch sensitive, so the sound is closely related to how hard you press each key.

### **7\. Roland FP 10** 

The FP 10 is a scaled down version of the Roland FP 30. This model weighs just 27 pounds with a sparse front panel to stream down the look and feel. However, there are still 15 sound choices, 14 time signatures, temp up and down, and metronome volume. The FP 10 also makes use of the PHA-4 action that feels nicely weighted and offers impressive push back on the key return. It has graded action, and there are five touchweight curve presets that allow you to find one to match your taste.

Like the FP 30, the FP 10 uses SuperNatural sound technology that involves sample acoustic pianos to provide natural control over dynamics with a sound engine reproducing damper resonance to create impressive sound ambiance. The FP 10 includes four piano sounds, including concert, mellow, and ballade piano. If the FP 30 is slightly out of your budget, the FP 10 is a great alternative.

### **8\. Kawai ES110**

The ES110 is the replacement for the ES100, providing newer sound and action. The 88 keys feature a matte finish to aid grip during a long playing session, yet it is the realistic action that makes this model stand out as one of the best in the price range. The ES110 keys are weighted and graded to create an impressive feel. Rather than using springs, Kawai uses actual hammers to create a light, responsive action. This action is further improved with the placement of dual sensors. The sensors are located under the middle of the key rather than at the key pivot point. This makes it easier to play more quickly and offers a more immediate key movement response. This makes for excellent key action in this price bracket.

The ES110 can also be connected via Bluetooth to an app to fine tune the sounds to your specific requirements.

### **9\. Casio Privia PX S3000**

This replacement for the PX 350 is a hybrid digital piano and arranger. It has a similar design style to the S1000, with a slim, futuristic aesthetic Casio calls “Grand Elegance.” The touch sensor buttons light up when in use to make it easier to navigate in poor lighting conditions when gigging.

The 88 keys feature synthetic ivory and ebony keytops to add texture and improve grip, but what makes these keys stand out is the action. In order to accommodate the compact size without compromising on providing an authentic feel, Casio has created Smart Scaled Hammer Action. The software tracks each key’s movement and location to determine what you’re trying to achieve and adjust response. This results in action offering dynamic control range and fast repetition together with the AiR sound engine to create an authentic acoustic piano feel.

### **10\. Korg B2** 

The recently release B2 is an improvement on the B1 to create a portable digital piano with excellent sound quality. This model represents a new generation of Korg digital pianos packed with selected sounds to replicate the legendary grands across the globe. There is a total of 12 sounds, including German, Italian, and electric pianos. The natural weighted hammer action keys produce the action of the hammers on an acoustic piano. The B2 key bed is touch sensitive, responding to every nuance of the touch from the tips of your fingers. There is also a number of connections to make it easier to record your compositions via your computer or smartphone. This makes the B2 an ideal piano for practice or performance that can even be incorporated into the B2SP package with three pedal unit and stand.
